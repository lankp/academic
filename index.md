I am a postdoctoral researcher for Department of Mathematics at [Universit√† degli Studi di Milano](https://www.unimi.it/en) under the supervision of [Amnon Neeman](https://www.unimi.it/en/ugov/person/amnon-neeman). 

During April 2024, I was a research associate at the [Simons-Laufer Mathematical Sciences Institute](https://www.slmath.org/programs/356). Prior to this, I was a PhD student at the University of South Carolina under the supervision of [Matthew Ballard](https://www.matthewrobertballard.com), as well as an M.Sc. student at the University of New Mexico under the supervision of [Alexandru Buium](http://www.math.unm.edu/~buium). 

Much of my work focuses on the application of derived categories to problems in both commutative and noncommutative flavors of algebraic geometry.

A copy of my CV may be found [here](/assets/LankCV.pdf).

Currently, I organize an [online seminar](https://danceseminar.github.io/) for derived categories and (non)commutative algebraic geometry, and will be organizing the algebraic geometry seminar in Milano during Spring 2025. Please reach if you are interested in speaking in either of the two.
