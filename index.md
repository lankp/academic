This is an online seminar tailored for young researchers, e.g. postdocs and graduate students, interested in triangulated categories arising in noncommutative flavors of algebra and geometry. It is a biweekly event with fifty minute talks coupled with upwards of ten minutes for questions. Unless otherwise specified, we run the seminar on DATE/TIME through MEDIUM.

If you are interested in giving a talk, then please reach out to one of the organizers. See HERE for contact information.

A schedule of past, current, and future talks can be found HERE.
